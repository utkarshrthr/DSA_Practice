    Given an integer array A of size N, find the first repeating element in it.
    Find the element that occurs more than once and whose index of the first occurrence is the smallest.
    If there is no repeating element, return -1.
    * [10, 5, 3, 4, 3, 5, 6]
    *   Brute force: for each element i, iterate over array starting from i+1,
        and return as soon as you find the element, O(n^2) time, O(1) space

        using mp, create a frequency map, iterate over array find firs element with frequency more than 1
