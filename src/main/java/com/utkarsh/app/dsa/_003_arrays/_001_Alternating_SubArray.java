    /* Problem:
      You are given an integer array A of length N, consisting of 0's & 1's, and an integer B.
      You have to tell all the indices of array A that can act as a center of 2 * B + 1 length 0-1 alternating sub-array.
      A 0-1 alternating array is an array containing only 0's & 1's, and having no adjacent 0's or 1's.
      For e.g. arrays [0, 1, 0, 1], [1, 0] and [1] are 0-1 alternating, while [1, 1] and [0, 1, 0, 0, 1] are not.

    // edge case, B = 0
