    * Given an integer array A. Decide whether it is possible to divide the array into one or more
    * sub-arrays of even length such that the first and last element of all sub-arrays will be even.
    *
    *  1. The array itself can be that sub-array.
    *  2. Divided array will not override.
    *   E.g., [2,4,6,8,10,12] => [2,4] & [6,8] [10,12]. [2,4,6,8] & [6,8,10,12] are not valid sub-arrays
    *   as {6,8} is common in both.
